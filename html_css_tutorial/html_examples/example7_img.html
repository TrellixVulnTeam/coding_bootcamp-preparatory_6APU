      If <em> a honeymoon is meant to be <strong>a celebration of love</strong></em> in an intimate,
      secluded, and most importantly, beautiful setting, <u>then the <b>Maldives</b> is the worldâ€™s
      best backdrop for all these things</u>.
      There are endless ways to let the magic of the islands dazzle you on your holiday as a couple.
      A dinner under the stars with the occasional flicker of candle light to bring you back into the real world,
      a daring getaway to a nearby uninhabited island all by yourselves for the whole day,
      or just lazing around in your private bungalow watching the endless turquoise waters while you are treated
      to an spa treatment in the room.
