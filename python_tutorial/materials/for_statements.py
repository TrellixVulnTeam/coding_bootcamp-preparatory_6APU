"""
for Statements
- The for statement in Python differs a bit from what you may be used to in C or Pascal.
- It does not always iterate over an arithmetic progression of numbers (like in Pascal).
- It does not give the user the ability to define both the iteration step and halting condition (as C).
- Pythonâ€™s for statement iterates over the items of any sequence (a list or a string), in the order that they appear in the sequence.

- Do not modify a sequence when you are iterating over it.
- If you do need to do that, do that on a copy of the sequence.
- The slice notation makes this especially convenient.

- Note that if we were appending instead of inserting, then if we were not using a copy we would end up with a disaster.
- We would enter an infinite loop.
- The following code will never end.
